 Data Structures

What do they do?
- Collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

- All have different strengths, no best one, just a best one for the scenario

- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? -> Linked List

- Web scraping nested HTML? -> Tree

- Need to write a scheduler? -> Binary Heap


ES2015 Syntax:

- JS is not object-oriented, but Classes syntax is used over it's existing prototype-based inheritance 

- Data Structures are going to be implemented as classes
